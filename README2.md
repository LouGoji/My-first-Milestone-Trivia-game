I have made my first trivia game on September 24th 2022. It was inspired by a YouTuber who also created a trivia game. This game I have created has html, css, javascript(frontend), scss, and TS. I have to look back at the instructions very carefully and thought about what questions I should add to my trivia game. At first I didn't know what pictures I should add so I took time to combine all the pictures I have found on Google and put them all in one picture using Photoshop to inspire each one individually for each question that randomly comes up. The object of the game is guessing which question has the right answer. you only have 10 questions and there is no time limit. You can also save your score when you get to the end  answering the questions. There's music also playing in the background  of the game in which they were from the board games called Nickelodeon Scene It and Disney Scene It. Which those soundtracks are the ones that inspired me to choose and more fitting to the trivia game.


For the coding of the trivia game itself. It took me a few tries to get which part of the code is right for HTML and JavaScript(frontend). I have a few bugs on both of them but I was able to resolve them after looking back at the instructions of the video I watched. I continued on working on the trivia game along the way by adding scss and typescript which are a whole new level for me. For scss it wasn't as easy to use them as CSS. But I'll admit it does add in the bright colors and makes the Buns more cooler. For typescript I'm still working on that and I hope to finish it up when I have time but in the meantime it stays in progress. I've also made 28 commits so far during my time with the trivia game project. If you would all love to view my project and play the game, the link is down below.
